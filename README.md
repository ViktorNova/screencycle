========

A 'single page web app' for a display TV, which cycles through displaying any number of other web pages in an invisible iframe thingy. Very useful and very simple

Do you need a screen to display a bunch of different information? Is it running on shitty hardware, like a Raspberry Pi or antique Android device that costs a few bucks? Use this thing!
It's stupid simple, and I almost feel embarrassed for putting it on GitHub, but if you need it, use this instead of hacking it together yourself.

It works in any situation. It even works on Dropbox.
